# Summary
This project is a case study for Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, which aims to analyze the differences in how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes. The ultimate goal is to identify differences and determine how to leverage these differences to convert more casual riders into annual members. The provided dataset contains information about bike rides from a bike-sharing service, which includes the unique identifier for each ride, the type of bike used, the start and end times and locations, the latitude and longitude of the starting and ending stations, and whether the rider is a member or a casual rider. The project will be carried out in six phases, with the end goal of creating a marketing strategy that will increase the number of annual memberships.
